If you donâ€™t want to use the script, you can do it manually:

1.Copy the Feather icon to ~/.local/share/icons/.

`mkdir -p ~/.local/share/icons
`cp /usr/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/feather.png ~/.local/share/icons/

2. Edit the Feather .desktop file:

`nano ~/.local/share/applications/feather.desktop

Change the Icon= line to: `Icon=/home/amnesia/.local/share/icons/feather.png

3. Make it executable:

`chmod +x ~/.local/share/applications/feather.desktop

4.
